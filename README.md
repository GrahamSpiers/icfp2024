## Plan

I'm going to use *python* since I don't seem to need extra computational speed.

- Create a directory structure for a common package, commands, and problems.
- Write code to get the second problem.
- Set up *pytest*.
- Start working on second problem.  What tools are needed?
- Add command interpret to eval ICFP.
- Add command echo to use the [echo] service.
- Add command scoreboard.
- Add generic get command.
- [lambdaman] cmds/lambdaman.py
- [spaceship] cmds/spaceship.py
- Redo lambdaman

- [lambdaman] B failures
- Faster spaceship.
- [language_test]

## *python* packages

pip3 install requests
